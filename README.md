# FPUT_Problem
Simulating the FPUT problem: modelling non-linear forces between beads on springs and their energy modes.

The code displays many facets of the motion of the beads, such as energies of different modes, phase space plot fo velocity against position and the system's "chaotic-ness", given by the Lyapunov exponent.

This project was a component of my 3rd year undergraduate Physics degree, worth 10%, for which I received a 1st.
